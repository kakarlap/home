		<h1 class="mainh1">ABOUT ONE DIRECTION</h1>
		<p class="member">One Direction is a British-Irish boy band consisting of Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson, 
		Liam Payne, and formerly, Zayn Malik, until he quit the band in 2015. The band was formed in 2010 after each of the boys auditioned individually 
		for the X Factor, a British reality show. All five boys were eliminated as individual singers, but 
		Simon Cowell, one of the judges on the show, decided to bring the five boys together to form a group.  
		Despite placing third on the show, Cowell signed them to his record label, SYCO Music and this was the
		start of their career as One Direction. Their debut single "What Makes You Beautiful" was released in September of
		2011 and was a commercial success. It also won "Best British Single" at the 2012 Brit Awards. To date, One Direction has released five studio albums: "Up All Night" (2011), 
		"Take Me Home" (2012), "Midnight Memories" (2013), "Four" (2014), and "Made in the A.M." (2015). All five albums
		topped charts in most major countries and generated many hit singles. In 2012, they were awarded "Top New Artist"
		by Billboard, an American entertainment media brand. One Direction has won several other awards, including six Brit awards, 
		four MTV Video Music Awards, eleven MTV Europe Music Awards, seven American Music Awards, 27 Teen Choice Awards, and more.</p>
