		<h2 class="memberh2">Mini Bio</h2>
		<p class="member">Liam Payne, also known as Daddy Direction by his bandmates, is one of the main songwriters of 
		One Direction. He was born on August 29, 1993 in Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England to parents Geoff Payne and Karen Payne. 
		Liam studied at St. Peter's Collegiate School and was both an athlete and a musician when he was younger. However, 
		when he failed to make it into the 2012 Olympic Games' English National Team, he decided to pursue music more 
		seriously. Liam started singing and acting with a local theatre group called Pink Productions and auditioned for 
		the X Factor at the age of 14. He made it in, but didn't go very far in the show, so he trained further as a vocalist 
		and auditioned again in 2010 at the age of 16 with Julie London's "Cry Me a River". This time, he was put into a five-member group and competed in the
		"Groups" category in the show. Once Zayn quit the band in 2015, Liam took over his vocals. After the band went on hiatus,
		Liam took some break time and he continues to sing and songwrite.</p>
		<p class="memberff">Fun Fact: Liam was born three weeks premature and with one dysfunctional kidney, so as a young 
		child, he had to take 32 injections in his arm every day in order to deal with the pain. However, in 2012, his 
		second kidney randomly started working!</p>
