		<h2 class="memberh2">MINI BIO</h2>
		<p class="member">Harry Styles, also known as "Hazza" by his bandmates, is the youngest member of the band. 
		He was born in Redditch, Worcestershire, England to parents Desmond Styles and Anne Cox. His parents seperated when he was 7, so 
		Harry and his sister Gemma were brought up by their mother in Holmes Chapel, Cheshire. He went to 
		Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School, where he and three other friends created a band called White Eskimo. 
		Harry was the lead singer and the band played around town and won a few band competitions. Meanwhile, 
		Harry also worked at a bakery in Holmes Chapel. In 2010, at the age of 16, Harry auditioned for the 
		X Factor, singing Stevie Wonder's "Isn't She Lovely". He competed on the show individually, but was later
		combined with four other soloists to form a group, which Harry later named One Direction. Following 
		One Direction's hiatus, Harry signed a record deal with Columbia Records in June 2016 as a solo artist 
		and is also playing a role in Christopher Nolan's "Dunkirk", which is expected to release in July 2017. 
		As of now, Harry is working on solo music and making his acting debut.</p>
		<p class="memberff">Fun Fact: Harry's hair wasn't always curly. He had straight hair when he was younger.</p>
