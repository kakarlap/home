		<h2 class="memberh2">Mini Bio</h2>
		<p class="member">Niall Horan, also known as "Nialler" by his bandmates, is the only Irish member of the 
		group. He was born in Mullingar, County Westmeath, Ireland to parents Bobby Horan and Maura Gallagher. His parents split 
		when he was 5 and Niall and his brother Greg lived with their father. Niall attended St. Kenny National
		School and Catholic Secondary School in Mullingar. He started playing the guitar at a young age and 
		performed in school plays and sang in school choirs as well. When he was 16, in 2010, Niall auditioned 
		for the X Factor with Ne-Yo's "So Sick" as a soloist, but the judges put him in a group with fellow 
		contestants, believing they would perform better. After the announcement of the band's hiatus, Niall 
		signed a deal with Capitol Records as a solo artist. His debut single "This Town" was released in 
		September 2016 and Niall went on to receive the award for "Favourite Breakout Artist" at the 2017 
		People's Choice Awards. Niall is currently focused on his independent venture as a solo artist.</p>
		<p class="memberff">Fun Fact: Before Harry came up with the name "One Direction", Niall suggested to 
		name the band "Niall and the Potatoes".</p>
