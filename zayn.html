		<h2 class="memberh2">Mini Bio</h2>
		<p class="member">Zayn Malik, also known as "Bradford Bad Boy" by his bandmates, is a former member of One Direction.
		He was born in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England to parents Yaser Malik and Trisha Malik. His father is Pakistani
		and his mother is Irish. Zayn studied at Lower Fields Primary School and Tong High School. Throughout his childhood,
		he was interested in different genres of music, including hip-hop, R&B, and Bollywood. In 2010, at the age of 17,
		Zayn auditioned for the X Factor with Mario's "Let Me Love You". Near the end of the competition, he was placed with
		four other boys into a group, which they later named One Direction. In March 2015, however, Zayn quit the band so he could
		focus on individual endeavours and producing a style of music he was more interested in. He signed a record deal with
		RCA Records and in Mrach 2016, he launched his solo music career with his debut album "Mind of Mine", which topped the 
		charts in several countries and proved to be very successful. Zayn went on to win "New Artist of the Year" at the 2016
		American Music Awards. He is working on advancing his solo career.</p>
		<p class="memberff">Fun Fact: Zayn, at age 8, had a reading age of 18. He got an A on his English GCSE,
		which he took a year early.</p>
