		<h2 class="memberh2">Mini Bio</h2>
		<p class="member">Louis Tomlinson, also known as "Boobear" by his bandmates, is the oldest member of the group. He
		was born as Louis Troy Austin in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England to parents Troy Austin and Johannah Poulston. His parents divorced when he was very
		young, so Louis took the last name of his stepfather, Mark Tomlinson. Louis attended Hayfield School and when he failed to graduate, later, Hall 
		Cross School. He was very active in his high school musical productions as he loved singing and acting. He also took acting
		lessons and played small parts on the television dramas "If I Had You" and "Waterloo Road" when he was a young boy. Louis 
		auditioned for the X Factor in 2009, but was turned down. He auditioned again the next year at the age of 18 with the 
		Plain White Tees's "Hey There Delilah" and was later combined with other boys from the show to form One Direction. 
		Once the band went on hiatus, Louis collaborated with Steve Aoki on a song called "Just Hold On", which was released 
		in Decemeber 2016. Louis is currently focused on taking a break and on solo material. </p>
		<p class="memberff">Fun Fact: If Louis could go anywhere, it would be to Narnia. </p>
